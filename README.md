### 5️⃣ Portfolio Optimization with Monte Carlo Simulations & Efficient Frontier  
📌 **Objective**: Optimize a **Tech Stocks Portfolio** using **Monte Carlo simulations** and **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** to find the most efficient allocations.  

📌 **Methods**:  
   - **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Generated **100,000 random portfolios** to analyze risk-return trade-offs.  
   - **Efficient Frontier**: Identified the **optimal set of portfolios** for different risk tolerances.  
   - **Sharpe Ratio Analysis**: Selected three key portfolios based on risk-adjusted returns:  
     1️⃣ **Min Volatility Portfolio** (Low-risk, stable returns)  
     2️⃣ **Max Return Portfolio** (High-risk, aggressive growth)  
     3️⃣ **Optimal Portfolio (Risk = 0.35)** (Balanced trade-off)  

📌 **File available:**
